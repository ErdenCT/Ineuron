1 1 1 1 </br>
2 2 2 2 </br>
3 3 3 3 </br>
4 4 4 4 </br>
</br>
I wrote a program named FullPatterns to print:</br>

5. pattern3 (Curtain like pattern)</br>
--> I defined each pattern under a different method.</br>

Jagged3D.java is for our jagged 3d array assignment of 10/28/2022. In our 3D array we have 3 schools as the first dimension of our array which are School-0, School-1 and School-2. School-0 has 3 classes, School-1 has 2 classes and School-2 has 2 classes. School-0 Class-0 has 5 students, School-0 Class-1 has 6 students, School-0 Class-2 has 3 students. School-1 Class-0 has 3 students, School-1 Class-1 has 4 students. School-2 Class-0 has 5 students and School-2 Class-1 has 3 students. I used Scanner to input student Id's for each class and school. The program prints every student's Id. I also counted the total number of students. </br>
